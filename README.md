## A transpiler for BrainFuck
bfcompiler is a transpiler for the esoteric language Brainfuck targeting x86 assembly and the gnu toolchain.
The entire codebase is written in C however later editions may include a python based interpreter.
It's in very early development. Also this is just a project I'm doing in my free time to learn git and c.
